# VibePatch: Discreet Safety, One Tap Away

## 🔒 What is VibePatch?

VibePatch is a discreet, skin-mounted safety patch that silently sends SOS alerts with a custom tap pattern. Designed for vulnerable users like women, children, and the elderly, it provides life-saving help when phones or speech aren’t an option.

## ⚠️ The Problem

In emergencies, many can't scream, speak, or reach a phone. Traditional safety tools like smartwatches or apps are expensive, visible, or slow.

## 💡 The Solution

VibePatch blends in like a bandage and uses a unique tap sequence to silently send help via Bluetooth, GSM, or Wi-Fi, with optional GPS location.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Tap sensor detects pre-set pattern
- Microcontroller (Arduino or ESP32) triggers silent SOS
- Sends alert to contacts or safety services
- Vibrates to confirm activation

## 🧠 Why It’s Unique

- Works silently—no voice, no phone needed
- Discreet design that’s invisible in public
- Affordable and scalable
- Prototype-ready using open hardware
